## Objectives

- Rebuild the user interface using Angular and modern frontend practices.
- Implement a REST API backend (planned: Node.js or .NET).
- Separate frontend and backend layers to allow future scalability.
- Explore best practices for modular architecture in Angular.

## Tech Stack

- Angular
- TypeScript
- Planned backend: Node.js or .NET Web API

## Status

Early development stage. Initial structure and components only; no backend integration yet.
